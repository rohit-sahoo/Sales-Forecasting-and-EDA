# Sales-Forecasting-and-EDA
This project finds out insights from the Sales Data using Exploratory Data Analysis and then uses Time Series Forecasting to predict the sales of coming 7 days from the last date in the dataset.

Technologies used: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
1. Created a time series forecasting model to estimate a store's revenue for the next seven months.
2. Implemented methods for analyzing time series data in order to identify useful patterns and extract meaningful statistics from the data.
3. Evaluated the time series forecasting model using the root mean squared error (RMSE) of revenue estimation, which yielded an RMSE value of 267.
